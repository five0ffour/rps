### Instructions

* With a partner, spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into a single game of rock paper scissors.

* Try to break it down into steps that you could code out.

* Think of basic elements like loops, if-else statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

* Be prepared to share your outlines approach.



2.   Initialize variables  of user guesses,  computer guesses and winner,  counters of wins, losses, ties
1.  Loop around this whole game
1.   Prompt for the user input of R, S, P,  and store in an user var 
2.   Randmonly craete a computer guess and store ) 
3.   Apply the game rules and declare a winner
            compare the results using an if (user )
            increment  the win or increment the loss or store as tie

4.   Write the ouptut to the screen,  user guess, computer guess, wins, loss, ties using the javascript getElementbyId



Game Logic
u = user guess
c = computer guess

if (u == c )
    declare a tie
else if (u == 'r') && (c == 'p')
    increment  loss
else if (u == 'r' ) && (c == 's')
    increment win

do the same logic
